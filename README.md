# Image-Compression-using-k-means

In this project, I have apply the `k-means clustering` unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.😁

This project , pre-process high-resolution image data for k-means clustering, conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, applying a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm ⏳ , Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images🐱‍🏍 , and leverage the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.
